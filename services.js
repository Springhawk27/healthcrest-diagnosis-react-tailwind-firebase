        description: "A CT (computed tomography) scan is a type of x-ray that creates 3-dimensional images of your body, including bones, organs, tissues and tumours. The machine moves in a circular motion around you and takes x-rays of very thin slices of your body to create a cross-sectional image.",

        description: "A computed tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays to provide images of what is hard and soft inside a body. These X-rays are taken using a rotating ring that is moved around the body. A computer can then turn all the X-ray images into 3D images. As CT scans involve many X-rays, they use higher levels of ionising radiation than other types of medical imaging.",
